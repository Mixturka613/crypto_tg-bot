##Cryptocurrency Telegram Bot

>The bot uses only one guzzle library to send requests. Everything else is implemented by hand and php. Basically I use Webhooks.

```html
        <img src="img/img1.jpg">
        <img src="img/img2.jpg">
```

```css
    body {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        display: flex;
    }
```

If you want to run this thing on your machine, then copy the repository and install the token in index.php. It is also important to install the bot on a server with the https protocol, this is a requirement of the telegram api. If the bot does not respond, try installing the webhook manually.
